git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
- Express (Backend)
- Google Gemini API

## Backend Setup

The chatbot requires a backend server to securely handle API calls to Google Gemini.

1. Navigate to the server directory:
```sh
cd server
```

2. Install backend dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:
```sh
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
PORT=3000
```

4. Start the backend server:
```sh
npm start
```

For development with auto-reload:
```sh
npm run dev
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Running the Full Application

1. **Start the backend server** (in one terminal):
```sh
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

2. **Start the frontend** (in another terminal):
```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:8080` and will connect to the backend at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

To use a different backend URL, create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```sh
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
